Clock-observe-simulation
==================
<h3>A TkInter program simulates Doppler effect and Relativistic Doppler effect on a set of clocks moving relative to observer</h3>
------------------

Tips before using:
  -The scale displays the speed in percentage of <i>c</i>(the velocity of light in vacuum)\n
  -Positive number for scale means the clocks are leaving us, negative number means approaching to us
  -The color change is due to the red(blue) shift
  -The research of how to convert <i>wavelength</i> into RGB display is noted in the clock.py
